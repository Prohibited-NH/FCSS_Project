# Book-Crossing Project

## Description
This project analyzes the Book-Crossing dataset to replicate findings from the original research paper (EXPLORING AND MITIGATING GENDER BIAS IN RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS WITH EXPLICIT FEEDBACK) and explore additional insights using Python. The project is part of the Foundations of Computational Social Systems course.

## Original Article Credit
This project is based on the following article:
- **Title**: *EXPLORING AND MITIGATING GENDER BIAS IN RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS WITH EXPLICIT FEEDBACK*
- **Authors**: Shrikant Saxena,Shweta Jain
- *Source**: (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02530))

The methodology and approach followed in this project is inspired by this paper, and the analysis is applied to the Book-Crossing dataset, which is widely used in collaborative filtering and recommendation system research.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- **Ratings.csv**: Book ratings provided by users.
- **Books.csv**: Metadata about books such as titles and authors.
- **Users.csv**: User demographic information.

## File Descriptions
- `Data Dum/`: Contains the Book-Crossing dataset files.
- `notebook/analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all analysis and code.
- `poster/Book-Crossing-Poster-A0.pdf`: A0-sized poster summarizing the project.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` to review the analysis or run it interactively.
